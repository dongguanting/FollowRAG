This was done in \"good Bohemian style\" and referred to the defenestration which had occurred in Prague's City Hall almost 200 years earlier (July 1419), which also at that occasion led to war, the Hussite war.

It is run at Sandown Park over a distance of about 3 miles and 5 furlongs , and during its running there are twenty-four fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late April. The event was established in 1957, and it was originally called the Whitbread Gold Cup.

The term is a contraction of \"dramma giocoso per musica\" and describes the opera's libretto (text). The genre developed in the Neapolitan opera tradition, mainly through the work of the playwright Carlo Goldoni in Venice. A \"dramma giocoso\" characteristically used a grand \"buffo\" (comic or farce) scene as a dramatic climax at the end of an act. Goldoni's texts always consisted of two long acts with extended finales, followed by a short third act.

The underworld itself—sometimes known as Hades, after its patron god—is described as being either at the outer bounds of the ocean or beneath the depths or ends of the earth.

The free element, which is a silvery metal, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element.

The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\"native silver\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite.
