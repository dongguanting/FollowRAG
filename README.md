We propose a instruction-following alignement pipline named **VIF-RAG framework** and auto-evaluation Benchmark named **FollowRAG**:

- **IF-RAG:** It is the first automated, scalable, and verifiable data synthesis pipeline for aligning complex instruction-following in RAG scenarios. VIF-RAG integrates a verification process at each step of data augmentation and combination. We begin by manually creating a minimal set of atomic instructions (<100) and then apply steps including instruction composition, quality verification, instruction-query combination, and dual-stage verification to generate a large-scale, high-quality VIF-RAG-QA dataset (>100K). 

- **FollowRAG:** To address the gap in instruction-following auto-evaluation for RAG systems, we introduce FollowRAG Benchmark, which includes approximately 3K test samples, covering 22 categories of general instruction constraints and 4 knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Due to its robust pipeline design, FollowRAG can seamlessly integrate with different RAG benchmarks

## üå† VIF-RAG


We broke down the VIF-RAG data synthesis process into steps and provided 10-20 samples for each step to assist with your reproduction. Be sure to replace these with your own input.

### :wrench: Dependencies
General Setup Environment:
- Python 3.9
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (currently tested on version 2.1.2+cu121)
- [Transformers](http://huggingface.co/transformers/) (version 4.41.2, unlikely to work lower than this version)

```bash
cd ./VIF-RAG/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### :rocket: How to Perform *VIF-RAG* Data Synthesis?


Follow the interactive Jupyter notebook VIF-RAG on ``vifrag.ipynb`` to reproduce our synthesize dataset.


### üéØ Training

We use the version of [LlaMA-Factory v0.6.3](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/releases/tag/v0.6.3). Thanks for their excellent work.

we also release our SFT version dataset as strong baseline in Table1:
- **SFT Version:** To make a fair comparison with VIF-RAG, we use the same amount of [ü§óShareGPT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dongguanting/ShareGPT-12K) and [ü§óRAG-QA-40K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dongguanting/RAG-QA-40K) as in VIF-RAG‚Äôs data synthesis process, mixing them together to fine-tune (SFT) different baseline models.

- **VIF-RAG-QA:** We release our SFT datasets, including [ü§óVIF-RAG-QA-110K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dongguanting/VIF-RAG-QA-110K) and [ü§óVIF-RAG-QA-20K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dongguanting/VIF-RAG-QA-20K).

### üîë Inference
You first need to perform inference on followRAG, and the pseudocode is as follows:
```python
followRAG_full=load_json('followRAG/followRAG_full.json')
data_inferenced=[]
for dp in followRAG_full:
    response=llm.inference(dp['prompt'])
    dp['response']=response
    data_inferenced.append(dp)
save_jsonl(data_inferenced,'results/finish_inference/data_inferenced.jsonl')
```
Please refer to the following template to prepare your result JSON files for subsequent evaluation. 
Your data_inferenced.jsonl format should be consistent with the following form:

```json

#TODO SXS

```


### üìù Evaluation
After completing the inference, run the evaluation script:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
python eval/main_eval.py \
    --input_file_path results/finish_inference/data_inferenced.jsonl \
    --output_file_path results/finish_eval/data_evaled.jsonl \
    --rag_eval_type mini \
    --result_log_file_path results/logs/results_log.jsonl
```
Our evaluation of instruction-following part largely draws on the [IFEval code repository](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/instruction_following_eval). We appreciate their excellent work!
